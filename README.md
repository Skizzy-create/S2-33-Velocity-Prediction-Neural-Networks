# S2-33 Velocity Prediction Neural Netwrks
 The S2-33 Velocity Prediction Neural Networks project utilizes neural network models to accurately predict rocket velocity. The models are trained using a dataset containing features like acceleration, altitude, and pressure, and employ activation layers to optimize prediction accuracy. Through data preprocessing and training, the models perform various operations to learn patterns and make accurate velocity predictions. The project incorporates visualization techniques, including plots of original vs. predicted values, to better understand and analyze the model's performance. The neural network structure consists of multiple dense layers, with relu and linear activations, culminating in a linear output layer. Overall, the project provides an advanced solution for velocity prediction in rocket launches.
