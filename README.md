## 🚀 Project Overview
🌌 The S2-33 Velocity Prediction Neural Networks project aims to develop an out-of-this-world predictive model for estimating the velocity of a rocket during its exhilarating launch phase. Brace yourself for an intergalactic journey as we dive into the depths of neural networks to unlock the secrets of rocket velocity prediction!

## 🌠 Project Structure
The project is structured into several key components:

1. 📊 Data Preparation: The training and validation data is loaded from CSV files using the Pandas library. We warp and shape the data to ensure it's ready for our neural network's adventure.

2. 🧠 Neural Network Model: Our starship 🛸 is powered by a multi-layered neural network model, capable of capturing the complex relationships between input features and velocity. The model architecture consists of layers stacked like cosmic layers of delicious interstellar pancakes.

3. 🚀 Model Training and Evaluation: Our neural network embarks on an intense training mission through epochs and batch sizes. It's optimized using the mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer, ensuring it reaches new astronomical heights.

4. 🌌 Model Visualization: Behold the visual splendor of our trained model! We use the ann_viz and visualkeras libraries to create stunning visualizations, revealing the intricate cosmic dance of connections within our neural network.

5. ⚖️ Performance Analysis: We assess the model's performance using the R2 score, a stellar metric for regression problems. The R2 score tells us how closely our model's predictions align with reality, giving us a glimpse into its otherworldly accuracy.

6. 🛰️ Prediction and Validation: Our trained model takes on the ultimate challenge by making predictions on new, unseen data. It's put to the test in the vast void of validation, proving its ability to navigate the uncharted territories of rocket velocity prediction.
